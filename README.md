I’m a Software Engineer with a background in **teaching** and **Information Science**.

I bring a combination of **art** and **engineering** to collaborative teams to build **beautiful** and **maintainable** applications.

Having lived in various countries, I have gained a **multicultural perspective** that helps me lead with **empathy** and **humility**. I am **self-motivated** and continuously seek opportunities to grow and learn on developer teams.
